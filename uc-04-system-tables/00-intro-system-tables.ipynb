    "System Tables can be used for monitoring, analyzing performance, usage, and behavior of Databricks Platform components. By querying these tables, users can gain insights into how their jobs, notebooks, users, clusters, ML endpoints, and SQL warehouses are functioning and changing over time. This historical data can be used to optimize performance, troubleshoot issues, track usage patterns, and make data-driven decisions.\n",
