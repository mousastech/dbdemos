-- MAGIC # Audit Logs with Databricks Unity Catalog System Tables
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC Databricks tracks all operations across our Lakehouse. This is key for governance and being able to analyze your Lakehouse usage.
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC This is made possible with the `system.access.audit` table. 
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC This table contains all informations to answer questions such as:
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC - All operation executed in your account and workspaces
-- MAGIC - Which operations are executed against your Unity Catalog objects
-- MAGIC - Who is accessing what
-- MAGIC - Who and When a table was deleted
-- MAGIC - Monitor critical table access
-- MAGIC - ...
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC ## Audit Logs table
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC The `audit_logs` table has the following columns: 
-- MAGIC - version
-- MAGIC - event_time
-- MAGIC - event_date
-- MAGIC - event_id
-- MAGIC - workspace_id
-- MAGIC - source_ip_address
-- MAGIC - user_agent
-- MAGIC - session_id
-- MAGIC - user_identity
-- MAGIC - service_name 
-- MAGIC - action_name
-- MAGIC - request_id
-- MAGIC - request_params
-- MAGIC - response
-- MAGIC - audit_level
-- MAGIC - account_id
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC Audit logs give you the ability to see what users are doing within Databricks. They allow you to see the actions users have taken, such as editing or triggering a job and when it occured. 
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC ## Query example 
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC The following queries are some example of audit analysis that you can perform.
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC Make sure you have read access to the system catalog to be able to run the following queries (by default available to admin metastore).
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC <!-- Collect usage data (view). Remove it to disable collection or disable tracker during installation. View README for more details.  -->

-- MAGIC To run this demo, just select the cluster `dbdemos-uc-04-system-tables-moises_santos` from the dropdown menu ([open cluster configuration](https://e2-demo-field-eng.cloud.databricks.com/#setting/clusters/1120-142228-ta06t4hw/configuration)). <br />
-- MAGIC *Note: If the cluster was deleted after 30 days, you can re-create it with `dbdemos.create_cluster('uc-04-system-tables')` or re-install the demo: `dbdemos.install('uc-04-system-tables')`*

-- MAGIC ### External Locations 
-- MAGIC External locations are a common way to load data from cloud object storage into Databricks tables. They can also be used for writing data out of Databricks for external processes. We want to ensure that data is being used properly and is not exfiltrating outside our doman. Let's see how many external locations are being created over time and which ones are the most used. 

-- COMMAND ----------

-- created external locations
-- monitor possible data exfilltration
select
  event_time,
  event_date,
  date_format(event_date, 'yyyy-MM') AS year_month,
  user_identity.email as user_email,

  action_name,
  request_id,
  request_params.name as external_location_name,
  request_params.skip_validation,
  request_params.credential_name,
  request_params.url,
  request_params.workspace_id,
